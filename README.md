# VoiceFor
VoiceFor is a Prototype made by Adobe Xd. It's main target is to let your voice be heard by others. That includes influencers, politicians, organizations, medias and others. It is a way to let people connect to one another to unite a voice. You are able to share and others will keep sharing to spread your petitions. You are able to create petitions not limited to any topics. You can also tag those who are involve and have the power to make a change from your voice. If you are tagged by another petition, you will receive a notification and are able to interact with that petition and choose whether to accept or decline.
